# Visualize CC Catalog Data

## About

The landscape of openly licensed content is wide and varied. Millions of web pages host and share CC-licensed works—in fact, we estimate that there are over 1.6 billion across the web! With this growth of CC-licensed works, Creative Commons (CC) is increasingly interested in learning how hosts and users of CC-licensed materials are connected, as well as the types of content published under a CC license and how this content is shared. Each month, CC uses [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) data to find all domains that contain CC-licensed content. This dataset contains information about the URL of the websites and the licenses used. 

In order to draw conclusions and insights from this dataset, we created the **Linked Commons**: a visualization that shows how the Commons is digitally connected.

A live demo of the project can be found in [here](http://dataviz.creativecommons.engineering/)
